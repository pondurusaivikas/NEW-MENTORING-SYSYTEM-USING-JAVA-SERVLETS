# Mentoring System

## Overview

The Mentoring System is a web application developed using Java Servlets, JSP, and Apache Tomcat. It provides a platform where mentors can connect with mentees for guidance and support. This project aims to facilitate an easy communication flow between mentors and mentees while allowing administrators to manage user roles and interactions effectively.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration system for mentors, mentees, and administrators.
- **User Roles**:
  - Mentors: Can create profiles, list expertise areas, and interact with assigned mentees.
  - Mentees: Can search for mentors, request mentoring, and schedule meetings.
  - Administrators: Manage users, approve mentor-mentee connections, and generate reports.
- **Mentor Search**: Mentees can search for mentors based on expertise, experience, and availability.
- **Messaging System**: Secure communication between mentors and mentees.
- **Session Scheduling**: Mentors and mentees can schedule mentoring sessions and track progress.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage user accounts and mentoring sessions.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Servlets, JSP (Java Server Pages)
- **Web Server**: Apache Tomcat 10.x
- **Database**: MySQL (or any relational database)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **IDE**: Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA (optional)

## Prerequisites

To run the Mentoring System, you'll need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Apache Tomcat 10.x
- MySQL database
- Maven (for dependency management)
- Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA (for development)
  
## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mentoring-system.git
cd mentoring-system
```

### 2. Configure Database

1. Set up a MySQL database and create a schema for the application.
2. Execute the provided SQL scripts located in the `/db` folder to create the necessary tables.
3. Update the database connection details (username, password, database URL) in the `db.properties` file or in the `web.xml` configuration file.

### 3. Build and Deploy

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ).
2. Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
3. Deploy the WAR file to the Tomcat server:
    - Copy the generated WAR file from the `target` directory to the `webapps` folder in your Tomcat installation.
    - Alternatively, configure the project to be deployed directly from your IDE.

### 4. Start the Tomcat Server

- Run Tomcat and access the application at `http://localhost:8080/mentoring-system/`.
